Dear Teachers, I think that there are some plans for extending novcourse for two more days (maybe next next monday/tuesday on 20/21 nov) for those who are interested to learn more content/practice more. I guess this is to ask for how practical it is/whether the two of you have some opinions on it. The other thing is to ask if there is any update on deccourse stuff (I don't think so but I guess I ask anyway) for about when/whether we have to do some kind of internal selection before deccourse sel. Thank you :D
